## Classify Traffic Signs Using Deep Learning 

I have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify 43 traffic sign images. This project could be practically applied to self-driving cars. 

The notebook covers the following tasks: 
- Import libraries and datasets 
- Images visualization 
- Convert images to gray-scale and perform normalization 
- Build deep learning model 
- Compile and train deep learning model 
- Assess trained model performance.

Please have a look at the notebook [here](traffic-sign-classification.ipynb) or open it on [Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k_fxt9ZRg5PHrhSzrQbvJaRXuoMngOj7/view?usp=sharing). The dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jENwtRJ85gA_glFhtswsUM_P2BNlI6Zg?usp=sharing).
